# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an AI-first component registry that complements existing AI UI libraries (AI SDK UI, shadcn/ui) by focusing on unique, advanced AI interaction patterns that are currently missing from the ecosystem. While AI SDK UI covers basic chatbots, completions, and streaming, and shadcn/ui provides general UI primitives, this registry will focus on AI transparency, enterprise governance, specialized AI workflows, and advanced interaction patterns. The registry will follow the shadcn pattern of CLI installation and copy-paste components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error state components with actionable feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API integration helpers, so that I can easily connect components to various AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to AI APIs THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for common AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL provide standardized response formatting
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and error handling
4. WHEN streaming responses THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for real-time data handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a component registry with CLI and documentation website, so that I can discover and install components easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the registry THEN the system SHALL provide a documentation website with live examples
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support `npx ai-ui add [component]` commands
3. WHEN viewing components THEN the system SHALL provide copy-paste code snippets as an alternative to CLI
4. WHEN integrating with existing shadcn projects THEN the system SHALL extend the existing components.json configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to use each component effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide interactive examples for each component
2. WHEN learning the API THEN the system SHALL provide clear prop documentation with TypeScript types
3. WHEN implementing patterns THEN the system SHALL provide common usage patterns and best practices
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and FAQ sections

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the components to be accessible and performant, so that my AI applications work for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization and lazy loading
4. WHEN components update THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specialized AI input components that go beyond basic text input, so that I can create rich AI interaction interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users need to build complex prompts THEN the system SHALL provide prompt builder components with templates and variables
2. WHEN users upload multiple file types THEN the system SHALL provide AI-aware file upload with preview and processing status
3. WHEN users need to configure AI models THEN the system SHALL provide model selection and parameter tuning components
4. WHEN users provide multimodal input THEN the system SHALL provide components for image annotation, audio recording, and document markup
5. WHEN users need guided interactions THEN the system SHALL provide wizard-style components for complex AI workflows
### 
Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the registry to integrate with existing shadcn/ui projects, so that I can extend my current setup without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the CLI in a shadcn project THEN the system SHALL detect existing components.json configuration
2. WHEN adding AI components THEN the system SHALL respect existing aliases and paths
3. WHEN components are installed THEN the system SHALL use the same styling approach (CSS variables, Tailwind classes)
4. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a registry backend that serves component metadata, so that the CLI can fetch the latest component definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI requests component data THEN the system SHALL serve component metadata via API
2. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL provide versioning and changelog information
3. WHEN fetching components THEN the system SHALL include all necessary files (component, types, styles, dependencies)
4. WHEN the registry is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and fallback options#
## Requirement 11
